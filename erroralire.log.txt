`git pull`	git pull command failed, at the same time git clone was fine
`w` 		failed by showing one user twice in one TTY
		appeares when syslogd was disfunctional and fixed automatically!
`cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg-minimal && make install`	unable to login anymore!
		solution for me was boot with CD and comment xdm in /etc/ttys
